# CRUDApp
For CRUDApp Assessment

The purpose of this app is to track animals in a zoo. Zookeepers who sign in or create a login can then use all CRUD functionality to see current animals, add new animals, edit current animals and delete them. 
There are routes built so that users could be saved in the database as well but I was not able to complete that.
It was my intention to have a specific user be the "Head Zookeeper" and allow only them all CRUD functionality.

Stretch Goals:
Add photos to each animals card
Allow for Zookeeper to generate a list of animals that they specifically have added
